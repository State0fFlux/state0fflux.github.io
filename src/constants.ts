        As a solo developer, I was in charge of creating literally everything you see in the final product! Here are some of my technical highlights:
        - Built core gameplay systems including player controllers, combat logic, enemy waves, and event-driven game progression
        - Designed flexible, data-driven architectures using ScriptableObjects to allow rapid content iteration without code changes
        - Iterated on playtester feedback to rebalance difficulty and improve player controls, prioritizing smooth gameplay
        - Implemented coroutines and optimized runtime performance to maintain responsive and consistent frame rates
